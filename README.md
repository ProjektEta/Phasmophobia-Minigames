# PHASMOPHOBIA AMONG US ROLES/RULES

## Roles.

- Innocent
- Imposter

## Rules

- There is 3 Innocents, 1 Imposter (and obviously the ghost).

- The Innocents have to complete all optional tasks and guess the correct ghost. (and survive)
- The Imposter has to kill every person, or make sure they get the ghost wrong.

- If the imposter dies, the game ends as an innocent wins.
- If the Innocents dies, before they can exit to the van Imposters win.

- Every hunt Innocents get to vote ONLY IF NOBODY DIED DURING THE HUNT.
- They can vote a player or to skip; voting out a player basically means they are out. They will still be alive but not able to speak, interact or do anything.

- ONLY the imposter can touch and move the Cursed Object(s).
